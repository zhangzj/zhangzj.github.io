<p><strong>Richardson Maturity Model(RMM)理查德森模型</strong></p>

<p>steps toward the glory of REST
一个成熟的REST模型，通往API设计的荣耀之路</p>

<p>A model (developed by Leonard Richardson) that breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps. These introduce resources, http verbs, and hypermedia controls.</p>

<p>一个REST模型可以分成三步走，分别是资源，HTTP方法和超媒体控制。</p>

<p>The Meaning of the Levels
Recently I’ve been reading drafts of Rest In Practice: a book that a couple of my colleagues have been working on. Their aim is to explain how to use Restful web services to handle many of the integration problems that enterprises face. At the heart of the book is the notion that the web is an existence proof of a massively scalable distributed system that works really well, and we can take ideas from that to build integrated systems more easily.</p>

<p>好书推荐：Rest In Practice，一本解释Restful web serivce怎么处理企业开发中遇到的集成问题。书中核心的观点是web本身是可伸缩的大型分布式系统，我们可以借鉴一下。</p>

<p>Figure 1
<img src="/images/Network/Figure1_stepstowardREST_overview.png" alt="" />
Figure 1: Steps toward REST</p>

<p>To help explain the specific properties of a web-style system, the authors use a model of restful maturity that was developed by Leonard Richardson and explained at a QCon talk. The model is nice way to think about using these techniques, so I thought I’d take a stab of my own explanation of it. (The protocol examples here are only illustrative, I didn’t feel it was worthwhile to code and test them up, so there may be problems in the detail.)</p>

<p>对于这个web风格的系统设计，Leonard Richardson有更详细的说明和解释，我这边先说说自己的技术memo。例子是说明性的，撒汤漏水，在所难免。</p>

<h4 id="level-0">Level 0</h4>

<p>The starting point for the model is using HTTP as a transport system for remote interactions, but without using any of the mechanisms of the web. Essentially what you are doing here is using HTTP as a tunneling mechanism for your own remote interaction mechanism, usually based on Remote Procedure Invocation.</p>

<p>模型的出发点是把HTTP当成数据传输的方法，没有任何web机制的使用。这时候http是一种管道机制，做一种远程交互。</p>

<p>Figure 2
<img src="/images/Network/Figure2_interacrionwithremote.png" alt="" />
Figure 2: An example interaction at Level 0</p>

<p>Let’s assume I want to book an appointment with my doctor. My appointment software first needs to know what open slots my doctor has on a given date, so it makes a request of the hospital appointment system to obtain that information. In a level 0 scenario, the hospital will expose a service endpoint at some URI. I then post to that endpoint a document containing the details of my request.</p>

<p>场景：到医院挂号，要预定某一个医生的一段时间诊疗。
在这个情景当中，意愿会开放一个URI出来，用户POST信息过去，带上一个日期和医生名字的body，返回response。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /appointmentService HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;openSlotRequest date = "2010-01-04" doctor = "mjones"/&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The server then will return a document giving me this information</p>

<p>服务器根据请求的参数会返回相应的信息</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot start = "1400" end = "1450"&gt;
    &lt;doctor id = "mjones"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;slot start = "1600" end = "1650"&gt;
    &lt;doctor id = "mjones"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I’m using XML here for the example, but the content can actually be anything: JSON, YAML, key-value pairs, or any custom format.</p>

<p>例子里面使用XML作为数据交换的格式，当然可以改，JSON，YAML，KV对等等自定义的格式。</p>

<p>My next step is to book an appointment, which I can again do by posting a document to the endpoint.</p>

<p>下一步就是挂上一个号，再POST一下试试看。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /appointmentService HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;slot doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If all is well I get a response saying my appointment is booked.</p>

<p>一切顺利的话，这个号就是挂上了。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If there is a problem, say someone else got in before me, then I’ll get some kind of error message in the reply body.</p>

<p>但要是出了问题，挂不上号，就会返回一些错误信息。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;appointmentRequestFailure&gt;
  &lt;slot doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
  &lt;reason&gt;Slot not available&lt;/reason&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequestFailure&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So far this is a straightforward RPC style system. It’s simple as it’s just slinging plain old XML (POX) back and forth. If you use SOAP or XML-RPC it’s basically the same mechanism, the only difference is that you wrap the XML messages in some kind of envelope.</p>

<p>到此为止，仅仅是一个远程调用系统。</p>

<h4 id="level-1---resources">Level 1 - Resources</h4>

<p>The first step towards the Glory of Rest in the RMM is to introduce resources. So now rather than making all our requests to a singular service endpoint, we now start talking to individual resources.</p>

<p>通往RMM的第一步就是引入资源resource。现在不是把所有的请求都指向一个service端口，要开始吧资源分开。</p>

<p>Figure 3
<img src="/images/Network/level1.png" alt="" />
Figure 3: Level 1 adds resources</p>

<p>So with our initial query, we might have a resource for given doctor.</p>

<p>一开始准备查询的时候这个URI里面就会带上要挂上号的医生的名字，所谓专家号。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /doctors/mjones HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;openSlotRequest date = "2010-01-04"/&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The reply carries the same basic information, but each slot is now a resource that can be addressed individually.</p>

<p>返回的还是同样的基本信息，只是现在每一个资源可以单独定位。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"/&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>With specific resources booking an appointment means posting to a particular slot.</p>

<p>对于特定的时间挂号就预定那个特定的资源了。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /slots/1234 HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If all goes well I get a similar reply to before.</p>

<p>所谓response，成功的总是相似的，失败则各不相同。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The difference now is that if anyone needs to do anything about the appointment, like book some tests, they first get hold of the appointment resource, which might have a URI like http://royalhope.nhs.uk/slots/1234/appointment, and post to that resource.</p>

<p>接下来想要挂上一个号，那就是向指定的URI-http://royalhope.nhs.uk/slots/1234/appointment-发送POST。</p>

<p>To an object guy like me this is like the notion of object identity. Rather than calling some function in the ether and passing arguments, we call a method on one particular object providing arguments for the other information.</p>

<p>这个更像是调用某一个对象，而不是给一个函数传参数的感觉。</p>

<h4 id="level-2---http-verbs">Level 2 - HTTP Verbs</h4>

<p>I’ve used HTTP POST verbs for all my interactions here in level 0 and 1, but some people use GETs instead or in addition. At these levels it doesn’t make much difference, they are both being used as tunneling mechanisms allowing you to tunnel your interactions through HTTP. Level 2 moves away from this, using the HTTP verbs as closely as possible to how they are used in HTTP itself.</p>

<p>在Level0和Level1当中，一直都是用POST方法，但有时候GET貌似更加合适一些。在Level2当中，会使用HTTP的方法，各种方法的用法更加贴近HTTP协议本身对这些方法的定义。</p>

<p>Figure 4
<img src="/images/Network/level2.png" alt="" />
Figure 4: Level 2 addes HTTP verbs</p>

<p>For our the list of slots, this means we want to use GET.</p>

<p>对于获取挂号信息这种，GET更合适一些。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET /doctors/mjones/slots?date=20100104&amp;status=open HTTP/1.1
Host: royalhope.nhs.uk
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The reply is the same as it would have been with the POST</p>

<p>返回的结果和使用POST是一样一样的。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"/&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At Level 2, the use of GET for a request like this is crucial. HTTP defines GET as a safe operation, that is it doesn’t make any significant changes to the state of anything. This allows us to invoke GETs safely any number of times in any order and get the same results each time. An important consequence of this is that it allows any participant in the routing of requests to use caching, which is a key element in making the web perform as well as it does. HTTP includes various measures to support caching, which can be used by all participants in the communication. By following the rules of HTTP we’re able to take advantage of that capability.</p>

<p>GET操作对于请求来说是安全的，无论请求多少次，返回的是一样的结果。</p>

<p>To book an appointment we need an HTTP verb that does change state, a POST or a PUT. I’ll use the same POST that I did earlier.</p>

<p>挂号是需要的更改状态的，所以POST和PUT更加合适。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /slots/1234 HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The trade-offs between using POST and PUT here are more than I want to go into here, maybe I’ll do a separate article on them some day. But I do want to point out that some people incorrectly make a correspondence between POST/PUT and create/update. The choice between them is rather different to that.</p>

<p>POST和PUT是有区别的，一般说是创建和更新的区别，具体的有点不同再说。</p>

<p>Even if I use the same post as level 1, there’s another significant difference in how the remote service responds. If all goes well, the service replies with a response code of 201 to indicate that there’s a new resource in the world.</p>

<p>像Level1一样调用POST请求，也是有点区别的，会又不同的response，返回的状态码是201，created。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: slots/1234/appointment
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The 201 response includes a location attribute with a URI that the client can use to GET the current state of that resource in the future. The response here also includes a representation of that resource to save the client an extra call right now.</p>

<p>返回201包括包括了定位属性，用的是GET请求的资源。</p>

<p>There is another difference if something goes wrong, such as someone else booking the session.</p>

<p>另一个区别是出错的时候返回的东西不一样。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"/&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The important part of this response is the use of an HTTP response code to indicate something has gone wrong. In this case a 409 seems a good choice to indicate that someone else has already updated the resource in an incompatible way. Rather than using a return code of 200 but including an error response, at level 2 we explicitly use some kind of error response like this. It’s up to the protocol designer to decide what codes to use, but there should be a non-2xx response if an error crops up. Level 2 introduces using HTTP verbs and HTTP response codes.</p>

<p>用返回的状态码来表示出了什么错误，409显示的是资源已经被占用，不是使用200再加上错误信息来表示。</p>

<p>There is an inconsistency creeping in here. REST advocates talk about using all the HTTP verbs. They also justify their approach by saying that REST is attempting to learn from the practical success of the web. But the world-wide web doesn’t use PUT or DELETE much in practice. There are sensible reasons for using PUT and DELETE more, but the existence proof of the web isn’t one of them.</p>

<p>现实中的实践不太使用PUT和DELETE方法。</p>

<p>The key elements that are supported by the existence of the web are the strong separation between safe (eg GET) and non-safe operations, together with using status codes to help communicate the kinds of errors you run into.</p>

<p>方法分成安全的，比如GET和不安全的操作，加上状态码来帮助判别出了什么错误。</p>

<h4 id="level-3---hypermedia-controls">Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls</h4>

<p>The final level introduces something that you often hear referred to under the ugly acronym of HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State). It addresses the question of how to get from a list open slots to knowing what to do to book an appointment.</p>

<p>最后一个Level引入常见的东西，HATEOAS，超文本座位应用状态的引擎。告知怎么get挂号的列表，然后怎么挂上一个号。</p>

<p>Figure 5
<img src="/images/Network/level3.png" alt="" />
Figure 5: Level 3 adds hypermedia controls</p>

<p>We begin with the same initial GET that we sent in level 2</p>

<p>这里的get和Level2是一样的。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET /doctors/mjones/slots?date=20100104&amp;status=open HTTP/1.1
Host: royalhope.nhs.uk
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But the response has a new element</p>

<p>但是response有一个新的元素在。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[various headers]

&lt;openSlotList&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"&gt;
     &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/slot/book"
           uri = "/slots/1234"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "5678" doctor = "mjones" start = "1600" end = "1650"&gt;
     &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/slot/book"
           uri = "/slots/5678"/&gt;
  &lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/openSlotList&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Each slot now has a link element which contains a URI to tell us how to book an appointment.</p>

<p>每一个好号现在有个链接元，包含了URI来告诉我们如何挂一个号。</p>

<p>The point of hypermedia controls is that they tell us what we can do next, and the URI of the resource we need to manipulate to do it. Rather than us having to know where to post our appointment request, the hypermedia controls in the response tell us how to do it.</p>

<p>超媒体控制着点告诉我们接下来可以干什么，直接可以拿来操作。</p>

<p>The POST would again copy that of level 2</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /slots/1234 HTTP/1.1
[various other headers]

&lt;appointmentRequest&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
&lt;/appointmentRequest&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And the reply contains a number of hypermedia controls for different things to do next.</p>

<p>返回的一大帮超媒体控制链接表示接下来可以干的事情。</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://royalhope.nhs.uk/slots/1234/appointment
[various headers]

&lt;appointment&gt;
  &lt;slot id = "1234" doctor = "mjones" start = "1400" end = "1450"/&gt;
  &lt;patient id = "jsmith"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/cancel"
        uri = "/slots/1234/appointment"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/addTest"
        uri = "/slots/1234/appointment/tests"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "self"
        uri = "/slots/1234/appointment"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/changeTime"
        uri = "/doctors/mjones/slots?date=20100104@status=open"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/appointment/updateContactInfo"
        uri = "/patients/jsmith/contactInfo"/&gt;
  &lt;link rel = "/linkrels/help"
        uri = "/help/appointment"/&gt;
&lt;/appointment&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>One obvious benefit of hypermedia controls is that it allows the server to change its URI scheme without breaking clients. As long as clients look up the “addTest” link URI then the server team can juggle all URIs other than the initial entry points.</p>

<p>这种方式明显的好处就是可以让server随意更改URI，不用修改前端的代码，只要搜索addTest链接URI就可以了。</p>

<p>A further benefit is that it helps client developers explore the protocol. The links give client developers a hint as to what may be possible next. It doesn’t give all the information: both the “latest” and “cancel” controls point to the same URI - they need to figure out that one is a GET and the other a DELETE. But at least it gives them a starting point as to what to think about for more information and to look for a similar URI in the protocol documentation.</p>

<p>也给前端开发方便的浏览可以做什么事情的提示</p>

<p>Similarly it allows the server team to advertise new capabilities by putting new links in the responses. If the client developers are keeping an eye out for unknown links these links can be a trigger for further exploration.</p>

<p>加一个link之类的也很方便。</p>

<p>There’s no absolute standard as to how to represent hypermedia controls. What I’ve done here is to use the current recommendations of the REST in Practice team, which is to follow ATOM (RFC 4287) I use a <link /> element with a uri attribute for the target URI and a rel attribute for to describe the kind of relationship. A well known relationship (such as self for a reference to the element itself) is bare, any specific to that server is a fully qualified URI. ATOM states that the definition for well-known linkrels is the Registry of Link Relations . As I write these are confined to what’s done by ATOM, which is generally seen as a leader in level 3 restfulness.</p>

<p>没有一定的规矩来限制返回的链接形式，标准是有的ATOM，RFC 4287</p>

<h4 id="the-meaning-of-the-levels-level">The Meaning of the Levels Level的意义</h4>

<p>I should stress that the RMM, while a good way to think about what the elements of REST, is not a definition of levels of REST itself. Roy Fielding has made it clear that level 3 RMM is a pre-condition of REST. Like many terms in software, REST gets lots of definitions, but since Roy Fielding coined the term, his definition should carry more weight than most.</p>

<p>What I find useful about this RMM is that it provides a good step by step way to understand the basic ideas behind restful thinking. As such I see it as tool to help us learn about the concepts and not something that should be used in some kind of assessment mechanism. I don’t think we have enough examples yet to be really sure that the restful approach is the right way to integrate systems, I do think it’s a very attractive approach and the one that I would recommend in most situations.</p>

<p>Talking about this with Ian Robinson, he stressed that something he found attractive about this model when Leonard Richardson first presented it was its relationship to common design techniques.</p>

<p>Level 1 tackles the question of handling complexity by using divide and conquer, breaking a large service endpoint down into multiple resources.
Level 2 introduces a standard set of verbs so that we handle similar situations in the same way, removing unnecessary variation.
Level 3 introduces discoverability, providing a way of making a protocol more self-documenting.
The result is a model that helps us think about the kind of HTTP service we want to provide and frame the expectations of people looking to interact with it.</p>
